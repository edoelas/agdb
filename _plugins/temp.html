<p>TESTSecond blog post, and on the same day. You can call me a workaholic. The truth is that I just wanted to write something more related to game development. There are lots of things I have already learned that I will be publishing during the next few days. Today we are talking about game engines. The title is a bit misleading since I will not talk just about game engines, I will also talk about frameworks and other tools, we could rewrite the title as: "About things that we use to do games". But it was not that catchy.</p>
