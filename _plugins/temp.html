<p>Imagine: today is the release date of the game you have been waiting for. Maybe ir is Star Citizen, Cyberpunk 2077 or the steam version of Dwarf Fortress. You spend a nice amount of money, download it and start it. Once inside the game you can’t understand the main menu. That’s not a problem, you just guess and manage to start a game. Sencond disapointment: you can’t see the in-game interface. The game is unplayable. It looks interesting, you devise some of the features shown in the trailer, but you can’t play it. It is torture.</p>
<p>This is an empathy exercise about what people with visual impairment feels with lots of games. Hopefully, most of the people reading this will not have this problem. Vision related disabilities have a huge impact on people's lifes, the least we can do as a game developers is to allow them to enjoy our games. At the end that's the goal of game developers, to create something for others to enjoy.</p>
<p>The report about <a href="https://www.who.int/blindness/GLOBALDATAFINALforweb.pdf">global data on visual impairments 2010</a> made by the WHO tells us how many people has moderate or severe vision impairment:</p>

<p>That means that 4.24% of the global population is visually impaired (0.58% blind and 3.65% low vision). We have to consider that those tests do not take into account the colour blindness. This data should give us a rough idea of how many people will experience visual difficulties when playing our games.</p>
<p>But don't worry, there is a way to help visually impaired people to enjoy our games: accesible design. During the presentation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa6fsPMqAmU">Accessible Player Experiences: A New Approach to Data Informed Design for Accessible Games</a> done by the <a href="https://ablegamers.org/">The AbleGamers Charity</a> in the 2019 <a href="https://gdconf.com/">Game Developers Conference</a>, they described accesibility with these words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Accesibility in games is about getting players having experiences in games alongside their peers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A more technical definition from <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/">The Web Accesibility Initiative</a>, an initiative from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a>, defines it as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think you get the idea. So the question now is: How do I make my game accesible? That question is tricky because it is really complicated to make a game 100% accesible for everybody. The conditions of our players can vary a lot and covering all of them can be a huge challenge. We, as indie developers, might not have the resources or experience of AAA game companies, but that's not an excuse to not to provide some basic accesibility features. In fact, indie games sometimes are the best ones at this, some examples beeing <a href="http://hyperdotgame.com/">Hyperdot</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/431940/Wildfire/">Wildfire</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1060600/Lair_of_the_Clockwork_God/">Lair of the Clockwork God</a>, all of them with great accesibility features.</p>
<p>In this post my goal is to cover two topics that will make our game way more accesible for the visually impared people and that are really easy to implement: scaling and colour. The key word is easy. Low effort, big gains.</p>
<h3>GUI scaling</h3>
<p>This is probably the most important accesibility feature. The hability to scale the GUI (Graphical User Interface) makes it easier for the people with <a href="https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/low-vision">low vision</a>.  It is based on a really complex principle: the bigger the easier to see. Seems easy right? You just need to make everything bigger and thats all. If you have designed interfaces for games before, I am sure you know that what seems easy on the surface ends up being not so much. This post is not about GUI design but I will leave you at the end some interesting posts about the importance of this topic since usually it is overlooked.</p>
<p>To continue the explanation it is needed to understand the different kinds of user interfaces in games. The most comon clasification is this one:</p>
<p><img alt="Diagram about the diferent kinds of game interfaces extracted from A sound idea: An investigation into accessible video game design for the deaf and hard of hearing" src="/agdb/assets/media/2021-06-06-About-easy-to-implement-accesibility/kinds_of_interfaces.png" /><em>Diagram about the diferent kinds of game interfaces extracted from <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319174070_A_sound_idea_An_investigation_into_accessible_video_game_design_for_the_deaf_and_hard_of_hearing">A sound idea: An investigation into accessible video game design for the deaf and hard of hearing</a>.</em></p>
<p>For the sake of this post we are just going to clasify them in two:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Non-diegetic</strong>: Does not belong to the fictional world. It is just seen by the players in the real world.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Diegetic</strong>: Belongs to the game world. Can be percived by the characters.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When making our game interface scalable we should allow to scale the diegetic and non-diegetic elements independendly. Just in case you are not following me: the user should be able to make zoom and scale the buttons without one thing afecting the other, it is not about changing the render resolution. This is useful not just for accesibility purposes but also to be able to adapt our interface to diferent display sizes and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_per_inch">DPI</a>s. I will add another suggestion: allow the text to be scaled independently of the non-diegetic interface (buttons, menus, subtitles etc.). Depending on our design choices the buttons and icons might be recognizable enough but not the text.</p>
<p>So far seems easy right? Believe me, you will have problems. Two elements will collide, the text will get outisde its box, some elements will look giant etc.</p>
<p><img alt="Wireframe sketch showing problems." src="/agdb/assets/media/2021-06-06-About-easy-to-implement-accesibility/sketch_problems.png" /><em>Wireframe sketch with problems.</em></p>
<p>Is a good idea to start the development of the interface with these features in mind. Having the problems shown in the image means that the interface was not designed properly, and that, besides the accesibility, it will not look good in all screen sizes and resolutions. If you archive to make an implementation with these features you will have moved a big step towards good design and accesibility.</p>
<h3>Colours</h3>
<p>Sometimes making things bigger is not enough. Some people will have problems if the contrast between the text and the background is too low. To solve this problem is recomended  to provide at least two palettes: one of your choice and another one with high contrast. A high contrast palette will help both, people wit low vision and colour blindness. But sometimes this might not be enough. We will start talking about high contrast.</p>
<p>How much contrast is enough? That is an easy one, 7:1 contrast ratio is enough for most use cases. Let me explain. Any colour (inside a colour space) has what is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_luminance">relative luminance</a>. Having the relative luminance of two colours we can calculate the contrast ratio with this formula:</p>
<p>$$ CR = \frac{L1 + 0.05}{L2 + 0.05} $$</p>
<p>Where L1 is the relative luminance of the lighter colour and L2 the relative luminance of the darker colour. In order to calculate the relative luminance we use this formula:</p>
<p>$${\displaystyle Y=0.2126R+0.7152G+0.0722B.}$$</p>
<p>But wait, usually we work with gamma-compressed RGB, so first, we have to decompress the RGB values to gamma-expanded values. We can use this easy to remember formula to do that:</p>
<p>$$ {\displaystyle \gamma ^{-1}(u)={\begin{cases}{\frac {u}{12.92}}&amp;={\frac {25u}{323}}&amp;u\leq 0.04045 \newline \left({\tfrac {u+0.055}{1.055}}\right)^{2.4}&amp;=\left({\tfrac {200u+11}{211}}\right)^{\frac {12}{5}}&amp;{\text{otherwise}}\end{cases}}}$$</p>
<p>Where $u$ is ${R_{\mathrm {srgb} }}$, ${G_{\mathrm {srgb} }}$, or ${B_{\mathrm {srgb} }}$.</p>
<p><strong>There must be an easier way...</strong> Yes, there is the <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">WebAIM</a> website which calculates all of this automatically. It also gives us examples of how different text sizes would look with those colours. If you are working with web technologies I recomend you to use the <a href="https://www.getstark.co/">Stark</a> google chrome extension. It allows you to select text inside a web and it will calculate everything for you. It also allows you to simulate vision problems on the whole website.</p>
<p>Okay, so now we know how to calculate the contrast, but how much is enough contrast? The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/">Web Accesibility Initiative</a> stipulates how much is the minimum and the enhanced color contrast in their <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?versions=2.0&amp;col_overview#contrast-minimum">reference document</a>. Take into account that this was thought for web, but those numbers also should work fine for videogames.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th align="center">AA (minimum)</th>
<th align="center">AAA (enhanced)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Normal text</strong></td>
<td align="center">4.5:1</td>
<td align="center">7:1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Large text</strong></td>
<td align="center">3:1</td>
<td align="center">4.5:1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We should aim for the AAA. Here there are a few test that I have done. The background always is the same, but the content changes to archive the desired contrast ratio.</p>
<p><img alt="Test showing multiple contrast ratios." src="/agdb/assets/media/2021-06-06-About-easy-to-implement-accesibility/contrast_test.png" /><em>Test showing multiple contrast ratios.</em></p>
<p>That does not mean that we have to create a palette where every color has a contrast ratio of 7:1 with all the other colours. We have to think about how are we going to use the colours and just worry about the contrast between elements that give information and its background. Quoting the Web Accesibility Initiative about incidental text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Text or images of text that are part of an inactive user interface component, that are pure decoration, that are not visible to anyone, or that are part of a picture that contains significant other visual content, have no contrast requirement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That means that we should not worry about the colours whose only purpose is to be used for decorations. But be careful, elements different from text that show information also deserve high contrast, for example, the lines that organize our UI. Here is an example:</p>
<p><img alt="Example showing where to use high contrast colours. The second column has an achromatopsia filter." src="/agdb/assets/media/2021-06-06-About-easy-to-implement-accesibility/ui_test.png" /><em>Example showing where to use high contrast colours. The second column has an achromatopsia filter.</em> </p>
<p>Just one color, used in the vertical separators, has changed. In the first example we see how the shadows are lost, but all the important information still is there. On the second example the vertical separators disapear. This information is not trivial, so we should avoid designs like this one. Also, it looks like crap.</p>
<p>As I said, a high contrast palette might not be enough. This is specially true when colours are meaningful, for example, colours of teams. In these kinds of situations is hard to design with high contrast. What if there are 5, or even more, teams? Should each one have a different luminance?  Thankfully these situations are not a problem for people with low vision problems. As far as there is enough contrast between the players and the background they will be able to see properly the shapes. But what for colour blind people? Let's see an example:</p>
<p><img alt="Example showing two teams, green and red, over brown background. The second image has a deuteronopia filter." src="/agdb/assets/media/2021-06-06-About-easy-to-implement-accesibility/teams_test2.png" /><em>Example showing two teams, green and red, over brown background. The second image has a deuteronopia filter.</em></p>
<p>The image has gone through a deuteronopia filter. If you have deuteronopia you will have a hard time playing this game. Deuteronopia is one kind of colour blindness, there are more. But what is colour blindness? The <a href="https://www.aao.org/eye-health/diseases/what-is-color-blindness">American Academy of Ophtamology</a> explains it in their website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Color blindness occurs when you are unable to see colors in a normal way. [...] Color blindness can happen when one or more of the color cone cells are absent, not working, or detect a different color than normal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our retina we have rods and cones. Rods detect light intensity and cones colour. We have three different types of cones, each type detect one colour: red, green and blue. The combination of the signal detected by the cones is transformed in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hue">hue</a> we perceive. It is not a coincidence that we use the RGB model. Deuteranopia, the problem simulated in the image, has to do with the green cones, they do not work properly.</p>
<p><img alt="Image showing simulations of the different problems related to colour perception." src="/agdb/assets/media/2021-06-06-About-easy-to-implement-accesibility/color_blind_types.png" /><em>Image showing simulations of the different problems related to colour perception.</em></p>
<p>Around 4.5% of the population has some kind of colour blindness. Just in case you did not noticed it, 4.5% is a ton of people. The most common of the colour related problems is Deuteranopia (problems with green cones), which results in a similar perceived colour palette to the second most common problem, protanopia (problem with red cones). These two probles usally are refered together as red-green colour blindness. Then there is Tritanotopia, which is really rare (around 1 every 10.000 people) and has to do with the blue cones. The last one is Achromatopsia, where your cones are not working at all and you see the life in shades of gray. Thankfully this one is ultra rare, afecting 1 person every 33.000.</p>
<p>At this point I think you already know how to make it easier for colour blind people to play our games. You are right, with an alternative colour palette. But which one? Don't worry, there are already made accesible palettes. My recomendations are The <a href="https://jfly.uni-koeln.de/color/#checker">Okabe-Ito</a> or <a href="https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/#sec:qualitative">Tol</a>'s palette. Both of them work really well, are widly supported and were created based on scientific evidence. As a curious fact I will say that the Okabe-Ito palette is the one used in the book <a href="https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/index.html">Fundamentals of Data Visualization</a> published by <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/">o'reilly</a>. Okabe-Ito's palette is composed of 8 colours while Tol suggest diferent palettes so we can choose the right one for our application. If you have to pick one I would suggest you to visit their posts with a tool to simulate the colour vision deficiencies (I recomend Spark) and judge by yourself. Personally I prefer the Okabe-Ito one.</p>
<p><img alt="The palette proposed by Masataka Okabe and Kei Ito: #E60F00, #56B4E9, #009E73, #F0E442, #0072B2, #D55E00, #CC79A7, #000000 ." src="/agdb/assets/media/2021-06-06-About-easy-to-implement-accesibility/okabe-ito.png" /><em>The palette proposed by Masataka Okabe and Kei Ito: #E60F00, #56B4E9, #009E73, #F0E442, #0072B2, #D55E00, #CC79A7, #000000 .</em></p>
<p><img alt="One palette proposed by Paul Tol: #4477AA, #66CCEE, #228833, #CCBB44, #EE6677, #AA3377, #BBBBBB ." src="/agdb/assets/media/2021-06-06-About-easy-to-implement-accesibility/tol.png" /><em>One of the palettes proposed by Paul Tol: #4477AA, #66CCEE, #228833, #CCBB44, #EE6677, #AA3377, #BBBBBB .</em></p>
<p>I think now it is an adequate moment to make a call to <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a> to change its default colour palette.</p>
<p>The final boss when it comes to color blindness is Achromatopsia. No hue at all. I have to admit that this one does not have an easy fix as changing the colour palette, but since we are here it is worthit talking about it. The only way to do it is not relying in colour, we need alternative ways to give the user this information. If your game uses colour to indicate things like kinds of enemies or different kinds of ammo you might think that this must be imposible. If there is a game called <a href="https://www.curve-digital.com/en-us/games/detail/5/hue/">Hue</a> which managed to do it you can do it too. Another one <a href="https://pixel-maniacs.com/chromagun">is Chroma Gun</a> that, you guessed it, is about colours. They just put icons on top of the colours.</p>
<p><img alt="Example of the accesibility features of Hue." src="/agdb/assets/media/2021-06-06-About-easy-to-implement-accesibility/hue_game.jpg" /><em>Example of the accesibility features of Hue.</em></p>

<p>Besides the accesibility, making a game where the only difference is in the colour feels really cheap. For example, if your enemy has evolved and now is stronger do not change it's colour from purple to red and call it a day. Add some spikes or fire to it's design, make it interesting.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>If you have reached the end of the post I am sure that you are aware of the importance of accesibility in games. Allowing these people to enjoy our games is the least we can do for them, and, as shown in this post, we do not need to invest exhorbitants ammounts of money or hire a specialist. With something as simple as allowing for an alternative palette and making things bigger we can make our game more playable.</p>
<p>Today we have talked about visual problems, but saddly there are way more. Maybe in the future I make a post about motor disabilities since custom periferals is an interesting topic. I cannot finish this post without suggesting you the videos from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqJ-Xo29CKyLTjn6z2XwYAw">Game Maker's Toolkit</a> youtube channel about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrqdU4cZaLw">visual</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObhvacfIOg0">cognitive</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ufe0i26DGiA">motor</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NGe4dzlukc">auditory</a> disabilities. They are a must. Each video consist in 10 minutes full of useful recomendations with examples of real games. Also he makes a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWQcuBigOj0">yearly review of the state of the accesibility in games</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Last minute news</strong>: In the last release of Minecraft, released the 8 of June 2021, Mojang has decided to change the classic ore textures. The reason is to make the game more accesible. Before all the ores had the same shape and just the colour changed, now the shape is different.</p>
