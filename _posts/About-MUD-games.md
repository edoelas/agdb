#### [MUD games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD)

A MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) game is a text based [MMORPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game). Everything is text based. The ones familiarized wit [Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork) know what I am talking about. Some text apears in your screen and you reply writting more text, that's all.

My first encounter with MUD games was around 4 years ago, trying to discover some kind of new exciting game. The game tha choosed me was [Balzhur](http://www.balzhur.org/). About my experience there is not much I can say since I just played it for a week. It was an interesting week. I remember that the begining was a bit... harsh lets say. I did not understand anything. I understood that it was tex based, but camon, not even a map? If you wanted to have a look to the world map you had to go to the website, go to the map section and search for an image of a map that looked like this:

![A map of sewers from the world of Balzhur.]({{ media }}/mud_map.jpg)
*A map of sewers from the world of Balzhur.*

I thought that it was stupid to create a game that was so much text-based. Okay, lets interact with text and all of that, but give me a nice UI for my inventory and a graphical map inside the game.

One day, lost, trying to find a NPC to complete a mission I asked for help. I don't remember how the things went, but it was something like this:

    ME.— Does anybody know where should I find the ranger after killing the bear?
    GALADRAH.— Which mission are you doing?
    ME.— The first one. If I just had a map with an arrow pointing at the location this would be easier.
    GALADRAH.— You have to climbe the tree to find it, but be prepared, he will try to atack you. I prefer the game without maps. I could not read it.
    ME.— Why? Unless you are blind there is no reason to not to put a map inside the game.
    GALADRAH.— I am blind.
    ...
    ME.— Sorry.
    ...
    FARSON.— Me too.
    MORGANA.— Yeah, me too.
    ODOLWA.— m2.
    SUSED.— I think more or less half of us are blind.

Suddenly I understood that it was better to keep MUD games 100% graphics free. MUDs are one of the few games that are blind-friendly, and as far as I know the only MMO.

For blind people text is the only way to interact with the computer. They use specialised software that reads the text on the screen out loud. I hope that from now on everybody reading this use alternate text on images.
