### Disabilities not related to vision.

In this post we have talked about the visual conditions, but there are more kinds of conditions that can be an impediment to play videogames. Reduced motor skills (problems with the movement) are another obstacle. These kind of disabilities have to do more with the hardware and less with the software, but that doesn't mean that we, from the software side of things, can't do anything. Granting compatibility with gamepads will allow the users to customize their setups to meet their needs. And you might say: "But my game was not made to be played with a gamepad." That does not matter, allow the players to decide if it is worth it or not to play your game with a gampad, do not take this decision for them. More often than not you will find that they will eager to try. If Age of empires II has a PS2 version you can also adapt your game to be played with a gamepad.

But which controllers should we make compatible with our game? At least the x-box controller.
